# TheRideYouRent
This a small azure application developed in my 2nd year at varsity. It was taken from my school github repo
## IMPORTANT
This was a 2nd year school project for one of my modules and after the submission deadline, I had to delete the azure services connected to this project therefore
this project no longer functions as it should and the messages below should be ignored. You can still analyse the code inside the zip folder
## Azure app service link
